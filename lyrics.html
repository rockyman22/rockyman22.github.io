        <h1> Jesus Of Suburbia </h1>
        <h2> Lyrics</h2>
        
        <p> I'm the son of rage and love <br>
The Jesus of Suburbia <br>
The bible of none of the above <br>
On a steady diet of <br>
Soda Pop and Ritalin <br>
No one ever died for my <br>
Sins in hell <br>
As far as I can tell <br>
At least the ones that I got away with <br>
And there's nothing wrong with me <br>
This is how I'm supposed to be <br>
In a land of make believe <br>
That don't believe in me <br>
Get my television fix <br>
Sitting on my crucifix <br>
The living room in my private womb <br>
While the Moms and brats are away <br>
To fall in love and fall in debt <br>
To alcohol and cigarettes <br>
And Mary Jane <br>
To keep me insane <br>
Doing someone else's cocaine <br>
And there's nothing wrong with me <br>
This is how I'm supposed to be <br>
In a land of make believe <br>
That don't believe in me <br>
At the center of the earth <br>
In the parking lot <br>
Of the 7-11 where I was taught <br>
The motto was just a lie <br>
It says home is where your heart is <br>
But what a shame <br>
Cause everyone's heart <br>
Doesn't beat the same <br>
It's beating out of time <br>
City of the dead <br>
At the end of another lost highway <br>
Signs misleading to nowhere <br>
City of the damned <br>
Lost children with dirty faces today <br>
No one really seems to care <br>
I read the graffiti <br>
In the bathroom stall <br>
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall <br>
And so it seemed to confess <br>
It didn't say much <br>
But it only confirmed that <br>
The center of the earth <br>
Is the end of the world <br>
And I could really care less <br>
City of the dead <br>
At the end of another lost highway <br>
Signs misleading to nowhere <br>
City of the damned <br>
Lost children with dirty faces today <br>
No one really seems to care <br>
I don't care if you don't <br>
I don't care if you don't <br>
I don't care if you don't care <br>
I don't care <br>
Everyone's so full of shit <br>
Born and raised by hypocrites <br>
Hearts recycled but never saved <br>
From the cradle to the grave <br>
We are the kids of war and peace <br>
From Anaheim to the Middle East <br>
We are the stories and disciples of <br>
The Jesus of suburbia <br>
Land of make believe <br>
And it don't believe in me <br>
Land of make believe <br>
And I don't believe <br>
And I don't care! <br>
Dearly beloved are you listening? <br>
I can't remember a word that you were saying <br>
Are we demented or am I disturbed? <br>
The space that's in between insane and insecure <br>
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void? <br>
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed <br>
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused <br>
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse <br>
To live, and not to breathe <br>
Is to die, in tragedy <br>
To run, to run away <br>
To find, what you believe <br>
And I leave behind <br>
This hurricane of fucking lies <br>
I lost my faith to this <br>
This town that don't exist <br>
So I run, I run away <br>
To the lights of masochists <br>
And I, leave behind <br>
This hurricane of fucking lies <br>
And I, walked this line <br>
A million and one fucking times <br>
But not this time <br>
I don't feel any shame <br>
I wont apologize <br>
When there ain't nowhere you can go <br>
Running away from pain <br>
When you've been victimized <br>
Tales from another broken home <br>
Oh you're leaving <br>
You're leaving <br>
You're leaving <br>
Are you leaving home?</p>
